## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ahmed-yesuf/A-renewable-source-power-plant-design.git
    ```
2. Execute `main.m`. You can also modify the content of this file to try different settings such as different battery capacity, varying the number of PV modules and wind turbines, and using different meteorological data.
